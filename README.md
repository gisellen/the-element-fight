The image shows a chart that determines which elements are vulnerable from other elements. For example, if PLAYER 1 chooses fire, and PLAYER 2 chooses wind, then PLAYER 1 will have a super effective damage to PLAYER 2 because of the element PLAYER 2 chose.
If PLAYER 1 chose fire and PLAYER 2 chose water, then PLAYER 1's damange will not be as effective.
